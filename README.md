# 🧠 SQL Learning Platform (Bangla)

A **free Bangla-first SQL learning platform** designed for serious learners who want **deep, practical SQL understanding** through concepts, real-life stories, and strict hands-on practice.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📘 **Concept-first learning** (no blind memorization)
- 🧩 **Real-life Bangladeshi scenarios** for every topic
- ✍️ **Mandatory hands-on SQL practice**
- 🔒 **Module locking system** (must solve correctly to progress)
- 🧪 **DB-Fiddle based practice** (no setup required)
- 🆓 **100% free platform**

---

## 🧭 How This Platform Works

1. Each module starts with **clear core concepts**
2. Concepts are applied using **real-life stories**
3. You must **write SQL queries yourself**
4. Until your query is correct, **next module stays locked**
5. Progress can be recovered using an **unlock code**

This is intentional.  
SQL is learned by **thinking and writing**, not reading only.

## 🧠 Why This Platform Is Different

Most SQL tutorials:
- Skip mental models
- Show random examples
- Allow learners to move forward without mastery

This platform:
- Teaches **how SQL thinks**
- Uses **real-world data logic**
- Forces **correctness before progression**
- Is designed around **long-term retention**
